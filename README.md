YouTube Live is also the second most popular livestream site, falling just behind Twitch. But while Twitch is known for gaming streams, YouTube Live’s users offer all kinds of content, including music performances, vlogs, cooking classes, makeup tutorials, instructional videos, comedy performances and much more.

## Some quick history:

* YouTube first experimented with live streaming in the late 2000s, including a U2 concert in 2009 and a Q&A with Barack Obama in 2010.
* They officially launched YouTube Live in 2011. The program was initially only available to select partners and was used for streaming the Olympics and Felix Baumgartner’s jump from space in 2012.
* The program has changed over the years, but it’s now available for all desktop users and mobile accounts with 1,000 subscribers or more.
